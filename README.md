# LSTM to predict temperature at noon
This project uses a Long Short Term Model (LSTM) developed with TensorFlow, Python and Jupyter Notebook to predict temperature at noon. It is part of a process of learning the basic concepts of deep learning and TensorFlow.

## Aim
The primary objective of this project is to explore the foundations of deep learning through the creation of a simple LSTM model, while working on real weather data. Although the model is basic, it has been designed to provide a first approach to both LSTM techniques and data prediction.

## Features
- Using TensorFlow to build and train a LSTM ;
- Prediction of temperature at 12 pm from historical data ;
- Visualization of results and model performance in a Jupyter Notebook ;
- Pre-processing of financial data to make them usable by the model (partly made with Apache Hop).

## Prerequisites
You will need the following dependencies:
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

You can install required packages via `pip` : 
```python 
pip install tensorflow pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn jupyter
```
## Project Structure
`/data ` : raw CSV files and Apache Hop pipelines and workflow to create `weather.csv`

`/model ` : trained model
